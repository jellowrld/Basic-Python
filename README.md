This code is a Python-based interpreter designed to mimic the functionality of a vintage BASIC programming environment. The interpreter allows you to run programs written in a BASIC-like language with support for variables, control structures, mathematical operations, and even simple graphics. It can parse, execute, and manage BASIC code, offering an interactive environment where you can perform computations, run loops, handle files, and even create graphical outputs.

The interpreter has features that simulate classic BASIC commands, while also expanding on those capabilities with more advanced features, such as functions, subroutines, and date/time handling. It supports both traditional text-based outputs and graphical outputs through the turtle module for 2D graphics and has an extensible structure to add more commands or customize behavior.

List of Features with Brief Explanations
	1.	Variable Management:
	•	Supports creating, modifying, and storing variables using the LET keyword, e.g., LET X = 5.
	
  2.	Input/Output:
	•	PRINT: Displays values to the console. Supports string and numeric outputs.
	•	INPUT: Prompts the user for input and stores it in a variable.
	•	FILE I/O: Supports opening, reading, and writing files with OPEN, CLOSE, PRINT#, and INPUT#.
	
  3.	Control Structures:
	•	IF/THEN: Executes a statement based on a condition, e.g., IF X > 5 THEN PRINT "Greater than 5".
	•	GOTO: Jumps to a specified line number, e.g., GOTO 10.
	•	FOR/NEXT: A loop structure that iterates over a range of numbers.
	•	SELECT CASE: Executes different blocks of code based on matching values.
	•	DO WHILE/DO UNTIL: Loops that continue based on conditions, either while true or until true.
	
  4.	Functions and Subroutines:
	•	DEF FN: Allows the definition of user-defined functions, e.g., DEF FN SQUARE(X) = X * X.
	•	CALL: Calls user-defined subroutines or functions.
	
  5.	Mathematical Operations:
	•	Advanced Math Functions: Includes trigonometric functions (SIN, COS, TAN), logarithms (LOG), and more.
	•	Radian/Degree Support: Trigonometric functions can handle both radians and degrees via RADIANS and DEGREES.
	
  6.	Date and Time:
	•	DATE: Returns the current date in a structured format.
	•	TIME: Returns the current time.
	•	DATE$ and TIME$: Return the current date and time as strings.
	
  7.	Graphics:
	•	2D Graphics: Uses the turtle module for basic graphics such as drawing lines, circles, and plotting points.
	•	3D Graphics: (Basic implementation with pygame for future development).
	
  8.	Error Handling and Debugging:
	•	Provides error messages and stops execution on errors. Debug mode can be toggled to give more detailed output during execution.
	
  9.	Program Control:
	•	RUN: Starts the execution of a program.
	•	NEW: Clears the current program.
	•	SAVE/LOAD: Saves and loads the current program using serialization (pickle), allowing for persistence across sessions.
	•	QUIT: Exits the interpreter.
	
  10.	Comments:
	•	REM: Allows adding comments to the code for readability and documentation.
	
  11.	Random Access File Operations:
	•	Supports opening files for input and output with specific file handles (e.g., OPEN "filename" FOR INPUT AS #1), reading and writing data to/from files.
	
  12.	State Management:
	•	SAVE Program: Saves the program and its state to a file for later retrieval.
	•	LOAD Program: Loads a previously saved program and its state.

Example Use Case
	1.	Basic Calculations:
	•	You can write simple programs that perform calculations, like adding two numbers or computing the sine of an angle.
	
  2.	Loops and Conditionals:
	•	With FOR/NEXT, IF/THEN, and GOTO, you can create loops, conditional checks, and more complex program flows.
	
  3.	Graphics:
	•	Create basic 2D drawings (e.g., lines, circles) or explore further graphics with turtle.
	
  4.	Interactivity:
	•	Use the INPUT command to gather input from users during program execution, making your program interactive.
	
  5.	Saving and Loading Programs:
	•	You can save your programs to files and load them later, preserving both your program code and the state of any variables.

This interpreter offers a flexible environment for both learning programming concepts and writing more advanced BASIC-like programs, with various modern features integrated into the traditional structure.
